# pawn-game

Each game has 16 fields and a pawn. The pawn is just a CSS class "pawn".

Please make the pawn move over the fields, moving every second, after its "Play" button is clicked.

The "Stop" button should stop the pawn of that game. Also, clicking outside of the board should stop the pawns.

Additionally, when one of the fields is clicked; the

pawn should move there and stop "playing".
